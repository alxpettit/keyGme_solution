# My solution to `keyGme by rion` challenge!

See `scratchpad.md` for some of my analysis, in a very sloppy, disorganized form.

See `keyGme.gpr` for relabeled code (Ghidra project).

See `keygen.py` for the actual solution code.

Go here for original challenge: https://crackmes.one/crackme/5c268e8333c5d41e58e00654

I know I can link to these files properly with markdown but I'm too sleepy right now.

Hope you don't mind me reposting the binary, rion! :P

In practice:

```
$ ./keygen.py
Your new key is: K0K1T3VWF5Y9F8JX
Have a nice day ^w^
$ ./keyGme K0K1T3VWF5Y9F8JX
Congratulation, You are registered now.
```
