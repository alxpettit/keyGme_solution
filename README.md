# My solution to `keyGme by rion` challenge!

See `scratchpad.md` for some of my analysis, in a very sloppy, disorganized form.

See `keyGme.gpr` for relabeled code (Ghidra project).

See `keygen.py` for the actual solution code.

I know I can link to these files with markdown but I'm too sleepy right now.
